# Qlik Sense Enterprise on Kubernetes - Support Templates
This repo is to gather scripts for deploying and automating Qlik Sense Enterprise on Kubernetes to public cloud providers. 

I will be adding to it over the fall as new releases come out for versions and be making pull requests with changes. 

You will notice that these are VERY verbose. That's on purpose. I want to assume you don't know anything about QSEoK or K8s. However, if you want only the things that are needed for QSEoK, feel free to check out the official documentation at http://help.qlik.com. 

## To Be Added

* Google Cloud
* AWS EKS
* AWS KOPS
* Red Hat Openshift

### If you came here from the October Techspert Thursday, Welcome!
